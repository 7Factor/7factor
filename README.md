# The 7Factors

Below are a list of ideologies that we believe help build human centric, high performing engineering teams. These ideas are obvious, extensible, encapsulated, and available for anyone to implement.

1. **Be a force multiplier.** Always make those around you better. Seek to teach, elevate, and strengthen the team, and do so mercifully.
2. **Improvement is never done.** Automate everything so we can fearlessly refactor.
3. **Do no harm to others.** Be ethically responsible and hold each other accountable. Do the Right Thing always.
4. **Curiosity is the chief architect.** Support and create a culture of learning and Kaizen. Embrace change and thrive in uncertainty. 
5. **Equality and diversity are first class citizens.** Be fair to all and give everyone's voice equal weight. Seek consensus, leave no one behind.
6. **Build Good Things.** Architect elegantly and implement rugged solutions. Embrace cutting edge technology and innovation.
7. **Love what you do.**
